# AuriInventory

*Finally, an Inventory Mod that Doesn't Suck!*

AuriInventory is the final inventory mod. Clean. Simple. Expandable. Yours. It has built in support for homes, bags, and messaging, and it integrates with the AuriSkins mod for skin support. It also features a recipe book and creative menu on the right hand side. 

If you're interested, check out the API.md (NYI) document for how to make your own add-on for the mod.
